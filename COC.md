## Our Basic Breakdown of Standards
We expect your code to benefit the repository and ensure that it creates a better environment for others who participate.
We expect that any edits to the code are beneficial to the script as a whole and provide good improvements.
Any criticism provided in this repository is welcome - but must be presented in a nonaggressive way. 

## Our Responsibility
We are responsible for any edits and/or comments left on this code and reserve the right to ban, deny pulls, and reject any negative introjections into our project.
Any malicious or harmful actions will be met with a timely and swift response to protect the fragility of our project.

## Diversity
No matter the race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other diversity - we will never create an environment that is unwelcoming. We will do our best to judge purely code rather
than participant, and efficiency rather than personality. 

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Malicious edits
- Hateful behaviors
- Unlawful distribution of our code
- Addition of viruses or malice code
- Breach of our COC or License agreement
